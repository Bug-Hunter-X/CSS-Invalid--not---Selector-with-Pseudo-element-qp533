This repository demonstrates a rare CSS bug involving the incorrect use of the `:not()` pseudo-class with a pseudo-element selector.  The bug occurs when attempting to negate a pseudo-element (such as `::before` or `::after`) directly within the `:not()` selector.  The solution provides a corrected approach, offering clarity on how to properly employ `:not()` for negating styles applied using pseudo-elements.
