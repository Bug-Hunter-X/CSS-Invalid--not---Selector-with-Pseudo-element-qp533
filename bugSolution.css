The corrected CSS uses a more appropriate selector that directly targets the elements where styles shouldn't be applied. Instead of negating a pseudo-element, the solution targets the parent element and removes the styles from its children.  If the requirement was to apply styles selectively to elements that do *not* have the pseudo-element, then a different approach may be required, involving checking for the pseudo-element's presence with Javascript.
